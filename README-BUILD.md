# SC Griefing Counter - Release Process

## Prerequisites

- GitHub account with write access to the repository
- Git client installed on local machine
- Up-to-date source code ready for release

## Release Process Overview

The release process is largely automated through GitHub Actions. The following steps are required:

1. Update version number in the codebase
2. Push code to GitHub
3. Create a Git tag for the new version
4. Push tag to GitHub (triggers automatic build process)
5. Monitor release status

## Detailed Instructions

### 1. Update Version Number

The version number must be updated in the `gui.py` file:

```python
APP_VERSION = "x.y.z"  # Replace x.y.z with the new version number
```

Also, you need to update the following files:
- The `CHANGELOG.md` file to include the changes for the new version. Add a new section following the format:
  ```
  ## [x.y.z] - YYYY-MM-DD
  ### Hinzugefügt
  - New feature 1
  - New feature 2
  
  ### Geändert
  - Changed feature 1
  - Changed feature 2
  
  ### Behoben
  - Fixed issue 1
  - Fixed issue 2
  ```
  The changelog entries should be based on the commits since the last release, but written in a user-friendly way that focuses on the benefits and improvements for the end user, not on technical implementation details.
- The `.github/workflows/build.yml` file under the "Create GitHub Release" section to include the relevant user-facing changes like UI improvements or new features. These changes should be summarized from the commit descriptions since the last release.
- The `SECURITY.md` file to update the supported versions table to include the new version.

### 2. Push Code to GitHub

After updating the version number, push your changes to GitHub:

```
git add gui.py
git commit -m "Updated version to x.y.z"
git push origin main
```

### 3. Create Git Tag

Create a Git tag that starts with "v" followed by the version number:

```
git tag -a vx.y.z -m "Release vx.y.z"
```

### 4. Push Tag to GitHub

Push the tag to GitHub to trigger the automatic build process:

```
git push origin vx.y.z
```

After this step, the GitHub Actions workflow will start automatically.

### 5. Monitor Release Status

You can track the status of the build in the "Actions" tab of the GitHub repository. After successful completion:

1. A new release will be created in the "Releases" section of the repository
2. The GitHub Pages will be updated with the new version
3. The version.json file will be updated for auto-updates

## If the Build Fails

If the automatic build process fails, you can take the following steps:

1. Check the error logs in the "Actions" tab
2. Fix the errors in the code
3. Delete the previous tag locally and remotely:
   ```
   git tag -d vx.y.z
   git push origin --delete vx.y.z
   ```
4. Create the tag again and push it again:
   ```
   git tag -a vx.y.z -m "Release vx.y.z"
   git push origin vx.y.z
   ```

## Automated Build Process

The automated build process performs the following steps:

1. Sets up a Windows build environment with Python 3.11
2. Installs all required dependencies
3. Extracts the version number from the Git tag
4. Creates a version.json file for the auto-updater
5. Compiles the program with PyInstaller
6. Generates a SHA256 hash of the executable
7. Creates an Inno Setup Installer
8. Creates ZIP archives with source code and compiled binaries
9. Publishes the release on GitHub Releases

## Build Process Outputs

The build process creates the following outputs:

1. **Windows Installer** (`SC-CombatLog-Setup-x.y.z.exe`):
   - A complete installer with all required files
   - Creates desktop and start menu shortcuts

2. **Portable ZIP** (`SC-CombatLog-x.y.z.zip`):
   - A ZIP archive with the compiled binaries
   - Can be extracted and run from any location

3. **Source Code ZIP** (`SC-CombatLog-Source-x.y.z.zip`):
   - A ZIP archive with the complete source code

4. **SHA256 Hash**:
   - A file with the SHA256 hash of the executable for integrity verification

5. **version.json**:
   - A JSON file with information about the current version for the auto-updater

## Manual Execution of the Workflow

You can also trigger the build process manually through the "Actions" tab on GitHub without creating a new tag:

1. Go to the "Actions" tab
2. Select the "Build and Release Star Citizen Griefing Counter" workflow
3. Click on "Run workflow"
4. Select the branch and start the workflow
