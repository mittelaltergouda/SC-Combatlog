## Reporting a Vulnerability

### How to report a vulnerability?

If you discover a security vulnerability in SC-Griefing-Counter, we ask that you report it responsibly:

1. **Create an Issue**: Create an issue in the GitHub repository with the label "security".
2. **Describe the Problem**: Provide a detailed description of the security vulnerability, including steps to reproduce, potential impacts, and, if known, suggestions for remediation.
3. **Confidential Information**: For highly sensitive security issues, please contact us directly rather than creating public issues.

### What happens next?

- You will receive an initial response within 96 hours.
- We will investigate the vulnerability and work with you to clarify additional details.
- Once the issue is confirmed, we will work on a solution and keep you informed of progress.
- After fixing the security vulnerability, we will publish an update with relevant information and acknowledgments to the discoverer.
